## ⇁  Welcome
I want to get good at algorithms, I mean REALLY good at algorithms. I also want to learn other languages. This is my fun folder where I try to achieve both those goals.

## ⇁  Repository structure
The project will be structured the following way:
```
├── language
│   ├── 2022
│   │   ├── day_1/
│   │   ├── ...
│   │   └── day_25/
│   ├── ...
│   └── 2015/
└── README.md

```
