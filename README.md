## ⇁  Welcome
I want to get good at algorithms, I mean REALLY good at algorithms. I also want to learn Rust. This is my fun folder where I try to achieve both those goals.

## ⇁  Repository structure
I want to eventually learn new languages with this so I wil structure the project in the following ways:
```
├── rust
│   ├── 2022
│   │   ├── day_1.rs
│   │   ├── day_1.txt
│   │   ├── ...
│   │   └── day_25.txt
│   ├── ...
│   └── 2015
└── README.md

```
